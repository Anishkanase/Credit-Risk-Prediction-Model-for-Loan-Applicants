Credit Risk Assessment Model
This project implements an advanced predictive model to assess the credit risk of loan applicants using historical loan application and repayment data.

Goal:
Minimize risks associated with bad loans by identifying applicants with a higher likelihood of default.
Maximize approval of safe loans to creditworthy applicants by efficiently evaluating their creditworthiness.

Approach:
Data Analysis:
Analyze historical loan data to identify risk factors associated with loan defaults.
Explore and understand the loan application process and factors influencing loan repayment behavior.

Model Development:
Develop and train a machine learning model to predict the probability of loan default for new applicants.
Utilize advanced techniques for feature engineering and model selection to achieve optimal performance.

Customer Segmentation:
Segment customers into risk groups based on their predicted default probabilities and loan preferences.
This enables the application of targeted loan offers and risk management strategies.

Benefits:
Improved decision-making: The model assists in making informed decisions regarding loan approvals, minimizing financial risks.
Efficient resource allocation: Enables better resource allocation by focusing on high-potential applicants while managing risks effectively.
Enhanced customer experience: Allows for tailored loan offerings based on individual creditworthiness and preferences.
